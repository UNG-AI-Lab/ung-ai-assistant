# UI Design Mockups

This folder contains the UI design drafts for the UNG AI Assistant.

## Files

- `Main Page.png` — Main three-panel layout showing student info, chat, and schedule
- `Specific Class Example.png` — Class detail overlay/modal view

## Layout Overview

The UI uses a **three-panel layout**:

1. **Left Panel** — Student profile: major, minor, list of completed classes
2. **Center Panel** — Chat interface: privacy notice, AI messages with citations, text input
3. **Right Panel** — Schedule cards (class name, time, professor) and professor detail with star ratings

## Design Notes

- Color scheme: UNG Navy (#003366) and Gold (#FFB71B)
- The UNG Nighthawk mascot appears near the chat input
- Class names in AI responses are clickable — they open the class detail overlay
- Professor names are underlined/linked for more info
- Privacy notice at the top: "Don't upload personal information"
